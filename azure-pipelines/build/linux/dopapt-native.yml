# Publishes the binaries + packages as artifacts.

# Version here refers to test package version, and follows format of 0.0.<Pipeline Build Number>
# This is due to azure universal packaging apis requiring semantic versioning
# Builds are monotonically increasing based on run number so test builds can always pull the newest version
